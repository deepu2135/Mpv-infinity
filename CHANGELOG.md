# Changelog

These notes are written in plain English and focus on what changed for real use.

## 1.0.4 — Public Feature Release

This release adds native media-server browsing and media-request workflows while preserving Mpv∞’s existing MPV and Media3 playback engines.

- **Jellyfin Client:** Connect to Jellyfin servers, manage saved Jellyfin profiles, browse libraries, search movies and series, view media details, inspect seasons and episodes, and play available content in Mpv∞.
- **Jellyfin playback integration:** Start authenticated remote playback from Jellyfin, preserve playback state, support series and episode navigation, and continue using the existing player controls and playback engines.
- **Seerr support:** Connect to Seerr and Overseerr-compatible servers using Jellyfin authentication, local account authentication, or an API key.
- **Seerr discovery:** Browse trending movies, movies, and TV shows with posters, ratings, descriptions, genres, cast information, and availability status.
- **Media requests:** Request movies or selected TV seasons through Seerr, including standard and 4K request options and anime audio preferences where supported by the server.
- **Jellyfin availability matching:** Match Seerr titles with the Jellyfin library so available content can be launched directly in Mpv∞.
- **Browser and player improvements:** Add the Jellyfin entry point to the app browser and improve remote artwork, playback launching, and media-library presentation.

## 1.0.3 — Public Hotfix Release

This hotfix keeps the tested v1.0.2 feature set and corrects the remaining branding, subtitle, notification, crash-diagnostics, and music-player issues.

- **Permission-dialog identity:** Replaced the inherited MpvRx repository link with the official Mpv∞ repository at https://github.com/ZHINFINITY/Mpv-infinity.
- **Media3 subtitles:** Improved subtitle position and scale handling for text and PGS bitmap cues, applied color/background/outline/drop-shadow settings to supported text subtitles, and refreshed settings when the Native renderer attaches.
- **Crash diagnostics:** Subtitle cue rendering is guarded, Media3 errors include codec and track context, and uncaught crashes are saved to the app-specific crash log before the crash screen opens.
- **Music playback:** Rapid-navigation notification metadata and artwork are synchronized to the final selected track, while music-player artwork resolution and entrance/minimize transitions are smoother.

## 1.0.2 — Stable Release

This release consolidates the tested improvements added after v1.0.0 across playback, queues, subtitles, library management, and performance.

- **Dual playback engines:** MPV/libmpv and AndroidX Media3 are available with per-item engine selection, automatic routing for supported Dolby Vision and HLS/DASH sources, safer engine handoff, and fallback behavior.
- **Reliable playback resume:** MPV and Native/Media3 preserve the active timestamp when the app closes, restore saved positions on reopen, and retain the position across engine changes.
- **Mixed temporary queue:** Audio-only files and videos can be combined in an editable temporary queue, with quick-play access, reordering, removal, queue persistence across media views, and correct transitions between music and video.
- **Audio player improvements:** Background playback, notifications, minimization, swipe-down dismissal, orientation recovery, landscape controls, visualizer layout, artwork, artist metadata, and rapid track changes are handled consistently.
- **Media3 playback tools:** Dual dialogue/sign subtitles, subtitle positioning and styling, chapter navigation, skip-intro and segment actions, frame navigation, improved seeking, larger local buffer headroom, and broader audio compatibility through the FFmpeg extension.
- **Streaming support:** HTTPS and other supported network sources retain configured request headers, including referrer settings, while cookies and network playback metadata are handled more reliably.
- **Video and HDR pipeline:** Device-dependent Dolby Vision, HDR10+, hardware decoding, shader rendering, Anime4K upscaling, GPU debanding, ambient visual effects, and adaptive quality controls remain available without lowering the normal playback path.
- **Library and queue usability:** Tree View cache reuse, reduced duplicate rescans, folder swipe-to-mark-watched, immediate New-indicator updates, nested-folder playlist discovery, search-result Properties access, and improved playlist sheets.
- **Customization and distribution:** Material 3 themes, translucent player controls, configurable gestures and layouts, subtitle font management, settings export naming, casting, scripting, and Standard APK variants for universal, arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, and x86_64.
- **Performance and stability:** Background polling and statistics backoff, thermal-aware shader and Anime4K budgets, safer Media3 state polling, reduced thumbnail pressure during large-folder scrolling, PiP shutdown cleanup, and improved lifecycle handling.

## 1.0.1 — Stable Release

This stable release consolidates the hybrid playback, mixed queue, audio-player, and usability improvements delivered after v1.0.0.

- **Hybrid playback engines:** MPV and Media3 are available for high-quality video and audio playback, with reliable per-item engine handoff and fallback behavior. HDR, Dolby Vision, HDR10+, hardware decoding, shader, chapter, subtitle, casting, scripting, and streaming capabilities remain available according to device and source support.
- **Temporary mixed-media queue:** Select songs and videos from different folders into an editable, non-persistent queue. The queue can be started from the Quick Play menus, keeps all selected items visible, supports reordering and removal, and advances across audio/video boundaries without replacing the queue with the first item’s folder playlist. Queue contents are preserved when another music view or media launch is opened, so video entries cannot silently disappear from a mixed queue.
- **Audio-player recovery:** Video-to-audio queue transitions now restore the audio player’s orientation, controls, metadata, minimize handoff, background playback, and playback notification state instead of retaining the preceding video session state.
- **Music metadata and artwork:** Artist information is preserved for music added to a temporary queue and used as a fallback when embedded metadata is incomplete. Album-art presentation and landscape metadata placement are improved.
- **Music-player UI:** Added swipe-down minimization, a cleaner landscape artwork-and-controls layout, visible landscape option controls, improved spacing, and a larger visualizer option target while preserving the existing portrait experience.
- **Media3 stability:** Position and playback-state polling uses the controller’s published state snapshot, avoiding unsafe cross-thread player access during playback and transitions.
- **Playback resume:** MPV and Media3 save the active timestamp when the app closes and restore the same video at its saved position when playback is reopened.
- **Tree View performance:** Duplicate startup refreshes are suppressed, scanner caches are reused when returning to the browser, and ordinary navigation no longer triggers a full storage rescan; explicit refresh remains available for library changes.
- **Folder watched gesture:** Swipe a video folder to the right to mark its videos as watched and remove the corresponding New indicators and folder count.
- **Search Properties access:** Long-press a search result to open its Properties/media-information screen directly.
- **Settings export identity:** New settings exports use the Mpv∞ filename format `mpv_infinity_settings_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xml`; compatibility with existing settings files is retained.
- **Standard distribution:** Stable assets target the Standard flavor and include universal, arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, and x86_64 APKs.

## 1.0.0 — Public Release

- **Foreground media playback:** The playback service promotes itself immediately with a minimal notification before media-session and playback initialization.
- **Public feature set:** MPV and Media3 playback engines, dual subtitle tracks, chapter-aware playback, folder playlist sheets, skip segments, adaptive controls, HDR and shader pipelines, casting, scripting, audio library mode, and the broader features listed in the README.
- **Distribution:** Standard APK variants only; no Fongmi or no-Vulkan variants.

## 1.1.26 — Media3 Subtitle Slots, Skip Intro, and Playlist Race Fixes (CI Candidate)

- **Dual subtitle renderer mapping:** The stale-cue guard now distinguishes custom text-renderer slots from global Media3 renderer indexes, restoring valid dialogue and sign cue delivery while still rejecting late callbacks from disabled slots.
- **Media3 skip intro:** Skip-segment detection now polls Media3 position and duration, and both manual and automatic skip actions seek through the Media3 controller instead of the unavailable MPV `time-pos` property.
- **Nested playlist race protection:** Folder discovery is marked in flight so asynchronous Media3 loading cannot overwrite a pending multi-item folder queue with a singleton.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation candidate; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and v1.1.25 behavior is otherwise preserved.

## 1.1.25 — Media3 Subtitle Cue Guard and Playlist Discovery Logging

- **Subtitle stale-cue guard:** SubtitleTextOutput callbacks from disabled renderer slots are now rejected; any cached cues for that slot are cleared immediately so a disabled sign track cannot remain visible after deselection.
- **Playlist discovery always runs:** The playlist-sheet refresh no longer skips discovery based on the Activity playlist size; fresh discovery runs on every sheet open for external file-manager launches.
- **Diagnostic logging:** Added detailed logs to sibling resolution and folder generation to expose which guard aborts discovery for nested MKV folders such as Konosuba.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation candidate; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.24 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.24 — Media3 Subtitle Cue Reset and Playlist Sheet Refresh (Unreleased CI Candidate)

- **Subtitle deselection cleanup:** Explicit subtitle toggles now clear merged Media3 cue buffers and create a renderer disable boundary before applying the new selection, preventing a disabled sign track from remaining visible.
- **Playlist sheet refresh:** Opening the playlist sheet now retriggers folder discovery through the Activity’s preserved external URI, including direct and compact-control entry points, so a singleton file-manager launch can materialize its nested MKV sibling queue.
- **Race reduction:** Folder discovery is triggered from one authoritative sheet-open effect rather than duplicate control callbacks.
- **Release scope:** Unreleased CI validation candidate; repository remains private, no release is being published yet, and the v1.1.23 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.23 — Media3 Dialogue+Sign Same-Group Fix and MKV Playlist Index Fix

- **Dialogue+sign same TrackGroup:** When dialogue and sign tracks share the same Media3 `TrackGroup`, both are now assigned to a single text renderer through a multi-index `SelectionOverride`, allowing both to render simultaneously without the toggle workaround.
- **MKV playlist index fallback:** The current-file lookup now falls back to filename matching when exact normalized-path comparison fails because content-URI and filesystem paths are represented differently.
- **Stable subtitle identity:** Track-map rebuilds preserve the desired subtitle selection using stable track identity keys rather than volatile synthetic IDs.
- **External launch session bypass:** File-manager `ACTION_VIEW` launches bypass stale saved playback sessions so fresh folder-queue discovery can run.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation candidate; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.22 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.22 — Media3 Dialogue and Nested MKV Playlist Hotfix (Unreleased CI Candidate)

- **First-load dialogue subtitles:** Dialogue and sign tracks from the same Media3 `TrackGroup` are now assigned one track index per text-renderer slot instead of being batched onto one renderer. This explicitly activates dialogue when both tracks are selected for the first time.
- **MPV-like sign readability:** Sign cues retain their embedded ASS/SSA position and alignment while receiving a compact opaque window and conservative cue-size normalization; dialogue sizing is unchanged.
- **File-manager MKV folders:** MediaStore folder discovery can recover a video row by display name and size when a SAF/content URI omits a numeric ID or `RELATIVE_PATH`, allowing ancestor-folder queue generation for nested season layouts.
- **Release scope:** Unreleased CI validation candidate; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and v1.1.21 optimizations are preserved.

## 1.1.21 — Playback Efficiency and Resource Cleanup (Unreleased CI Candidate)

- **Reduced duplicate UI work:** Media3 state callbacks now suppress identical snapshots while retaining the 250 ms live position updates needed by the seekbar and controls.
- **Lower subtitle overhead:** Sign-track detection reuses a compiled pattern and cached renderer classification instead of rescanning and lowercasing track titles for every cue batch.
- **Resource cleanup:** Artwork and embedded-lyrics metadata fallbacks now release `MediaMetadataRetriever` even when data-source or metadata extraction fails.
- **Quality preservation:** No video/audio resolution, decoder selection, bitrate, subtitle positioning, playback timing, or MPV music-player behavior was reduced or changed by this optimization pass.
- **Release scope:** Unreleased CI validation candidate; repository remains private, no release tag is created, and all v1.1.20 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.20 — Media3 Subtitle First-Load and MKV Playlist Hotfix

- **First-load dual subtitles:** A bounded retry of up to four attempts at 120 ms intervals reapplies the explicit renderer-specific subtitle overrides after each track-map update, so selecting dialogue and signs works immediately without toggling one track off and back on.
- **Sign subtitle readability:** Sign-track cues receive a dark window treatment while preserving their embedded ASS/SSA position and alignment, preventing sign colors from blending with the underlying source sign.
- **MKV folder playlist:** The season-folder recursive sibling scan now runs for all launch sources, including file-manager launches, not only video-list launches. This fixes Konosuba and similar nested-season-folder playlist-sheet failures.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.19 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.19 — Media3 Subtitle and Nested MKV Playlist Hotfix

- **First-load simultaneous subtitles:** Text-renderer-specific overrides are cleared before each explicit Media3 subtitle assignment, so selecting dialogue and signs works immediately without toggling one track off and on.
- **Readable sign windows:** Embedded cue windows retain their ASS/SSA positioning while opaque backgrounds are reduced to adaptive semi-transparent colors, keeping signs readable without hiding the source image.
- **Nested MKV folders:** Folder discovery keeps the immediate season folder as the default and falls back to ancestor/descendant scanning or MediaStore ancestor paths when nested Anime/Show/Season layouts otherwise produce a singleton queue.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.18 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.18 — Media3 Subtitle and MKV Playlist Sheet Hotfix

- **Media3 simultaneous subtitles:** Dialogue and sign selections now remain selected across track-change callbacks and are assigned to separate text-renderer slots, so both cue streams can render continuously together.
- **MKV playlist sheet:** The playlist sheet now refreshes from the live queue when asynchronous folder discovery publishes sibling items.
- **Playlist interaction recovery:** An empty or still-loading Playlist state no longer blocks ordinary screen taps; it self-dismisses if no multi-item queue appears.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.17 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.17 — Media3 Double-Tap Feedback Hotfix

- **Double-tap seek indicator:** Media3 now uses its live position and duration when updating the shared double-tap seek state, so the visible `+10`/`-10` text and chevron indicator appear just as they do with MPV. The actual seek operation remains unchanged for both engines.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.16 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.16 — Media3 Subtitle, Chapter, Playlist, and Position Hotfix

- **ASS drawing artifact:** Broadened Media3’s ASS drawing-command detection to remove coordinate-only drawing cues such as `m x y l x y` without removing dialogue or sign cues.
- **Media3 dialogue and signs:** The merged cue list is now filtered after PlayerView’s own cue update, so selected dialogue and sign subtitles remain renderable together.
- **Media3 chapters:** Matroska Chapter entries are also extracted from track Format metadata, covering files where the global metadata callback does not receive chapters.
- **MKV folder playlist:** The asynchronous multi-item queue is no longer replaced by a singleton when Media3 starts loading before folder discovery finishes.
- **Queue position:** Automatic transitions to a different queued item now start at 00:00 instead of inheriting the previous Media3 item’s position.
- **Release scope:** CI-only validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.15 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.15 — Media3 Chapters, Subtitles, and Playlist Hotfix

- **Media3 chapters:** Matroska and other supported Media3 chapter metadata now feeds the existing chapter sheet; files without supported chapter metadata keep the chapter button hidden, while MPV chapter behavior is unchanged.
- **Media3 dialogue and signs:** Removed the controller-side cue replacement that could discard the dialogue stream when dialogue and sign subtitle tracks were selected together; PlayerView now retains Media3’s native merged cue handling.
- **ASS drawing artifact:** Corrected the raw-string whitespace and numeric-token regex used for ASS drawing-command detection.
- **Playlist controls:** The playlist sheet no longer triggers the playback auto-hide timer after opening, keeping the folder card and its controls visible while browsing a queue.
- **Release scope:** Unreleased CI validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.14 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.14 — Gesture, Playlist, and Media3 Subtitle Hotfix

- **Media3 hold speed:** Long-press speed gestures now read and restore the live Media3 playback state instead of stale MPV pause and speed properties.
- **Folder playlist sheet:** Multi-item folder queues are now exposed to the playlist card in both MPV and Media3, including ordinary folders outside the Reels path. The playlist swipe path also keeps controls visible when opening the sheet.
- **Media3 subtitle sheet refresh:** Selecting or removing a subtitle publishes the updated selection immediately so the open sheet reflects the change without being dismissed and reopened.
- **ASS drawing artifact:** Media3 filters malformed ASS vector drawing-command cues that were being displayed as numeric text in the video corner, while preserving positioned sign cues.
- **Release scope:** Unreleased validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.13 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.13 — Media3 Subtitle Rendering Hotfix

- **ASS/SSA sign positioning:** Native/Media3 subtitles now honor embedded alignment and position tags while retaining the app’s subtitle scale control, preventing sign subtitles from being stacked, oversized, or misplaced.
- **Simultaneous subtitle tracks:** Native/Media3 can keep dialogue and sign tracks selected together, and tapping an active track removes only that track instead of disabling every subtitle.
- **Subtitle Off action:** The subtitle sheet now disables the active engine correctly; MPV subtitle properties remain unchanged for MPV playback.
- **Release scope:** Unreleased CI validation build; repository remains private, only Standard APK variants are in scope, and all v1.1.12 fixes are preserved.

## 1.1.12 — Portrait Controls and Media3 Gesture Hotfix

- **Portrait bottom controls:** The vertical player now renders the same saved buttons, membership, and order configured in Edit Portrait Bottom, including added and removed controls.
- **Media3 hold speed:** The Hold for multi-x speed gesture now routes through the engine-aware playback-speed setter, so the configured speed applies to Media3 and returns to the prior speed after release.
- **Queue position:** Queued Media3/Native transitions keep the start-at-zero guard through asynchronous state restoration instead of reapplying the previous video’s position.
- **Folder playlist card:** The folder playlist button opens the existing Now Playing card without triggering the generic control-hide action.
- **Release scope:** Private repository; Standard APK variants only. MPV behavior and previously working music, pause-button, subtitle, and playback paths are preserved.

## 1.1.11 — Playlist Card and Portrait Pause Hotfix

- **Folder playlist card:** The portrait top-bar episode pill now opens the existing bottom “Now Playing” card for the videos in the loaded folder, including the item count, thumbnails, current-item highlight, metadata, and reorder handles.
- **Playlist button availability:** The episode pill remains tappable for an explicit folder queue even when the general playlist preference is disabled; other playlist controls and playback behavior are unchanged.
- **Circular pause indication:** Preserved the portrait pause/resume button’s circular clipping so the pressed state does not show a blue rectangular overlay.
- **Release scope:** Private repository; Standard APK variants only.

## 1.1.10 — Queue Episode Start Hotfix

- **Next and previous items start at 00:00:** Queue navigation and automatic playlist advancement no longer reuse the prior video’s saved or engine-handoff position.
- **Same-video resume preserved:** Reopening the same video directly can still restore that video’s own saved position.
- **Previous fixes preserved:** The working MPV-only music player and circular portrait pause-button indication remain unchanged.
- **Release scope:** Private repository; Standard APK variants only.

## 1.1.9 — Portrait Pause Button UI Hotfix

- **Circular pressed indication:** Clipped the portrait video pause/resume button’s interaction layer to its circular shape so the blue rectangular pressed overlay no longer appears when pausing or resuming.
- **Playback behavior preserved:** The pause/resume action, circular control appearance, and MPV music-player implementation are unchanged.
- **Release scope:** Private repository; Standard APK variants only.

## 1.1.8 — MPV-Only Music Ownership Hotfix

- **MPV-only audio routing:** Audio items are now forced through MPV before any global engine, Media3, or Dolby/Auto decision. Delayed video-track callbacks cannot hand the current song back to Media3.
- **Shared-container audio:** An explicit audio launch remains MPV-owned even when a shared container such as MKV reports a `video/*` MIME type.
- **Responsive controls:** MPV pause/resume no longer becomes a no-op because of a temporary Android audio-focus failure, and the current audio generation remains the command target for seeking and timeline updates.
- **Stale title prevention:** The current audio queue item and path now take precedence over a stale `media-title` left by the previous video.
- **Release scope:** This is a Standard APK hotfix; music remains MPV-based, the repository remains private, and upstream MPV/mpvRx attribution is preserved.

## 1.1.7 — MPV Music Player Metadata and Timeline Hotfix

- **Track information:** Audio controls now receive MPV’s live `media-title` and keep the title available during direct audio launches and queue transitions.
- **Cover art and embedded metadata:** Artwork and presentation metadata no longer become permanently blank when the audio screen appears before MPV emits `FILE_LOADED`; extraction retries after the load phase becomes ready.
- **Lyrics:** Lyrics lookup waits for a real MPV duration, retries when the loaded audio timeline becomes available, and ignores stale results from a previous track.
- **Seekbar:** The MPV audio timeline poller now recognizes the audio-load ownership hint, so direct music playback continuously updates position and duration instead of remaining at a placeholder.
- **Release scope:** This is a Standard APK hotfix; MPV remains the music engine, the repository remains private, and upstream MPV/mpvRx attribution is preserved.

## 1.1.6 — MPV Music Controls Hotfix

- **MPV music controls:** Audio-only transitions now explicitly retain MPV ownership, including audio containers such as MKV, so pause/resume, seek, speed, and track commands are not routed to a stale Native/Media3 player after returning from video playback.
- **Music timeline and metadata:** Audio loads now refresh MPV position and duration state, update the current title, and preserve the audio hint through queue navigation so the seekbar and song information remain synchronized.
- **Vertical pause button:** Removed the default rectangular pressed indication from the circular vertical video pause/resume control while preserving its touch behavior and circular shape.
- **Previous fixes preserved:** Includes the v1.1.5 portrait seekbar redesign and v1.1.4 video-startup crash protection. The repository remains private and only Standard APK variants are released.

## 1.1.4 — Video Startup Crash Hotfix

- **Video startup crash:** Prevented the MPV state poller and audio-routing check from dereferencing the player host before the Activity has attached it. This fixes the crash when opening a video after the v1.1.3 audio recovery changes.
- **Music-player behavior preserved:** Audio remains MPV-based, and the v1.1.3 music control/timeline recovery remains included.
- **Portrait controls preserved:** The v1.1.3 symmetric portrait seekbar-card redesign remains included.
- **Release scope:** This is a Standard APK corrective hotfix for v1.1.3; the repository remains private and upstream MPV/mpvRx attribution is preserved.

## 1.1.3 — Portrait Controls and Music Player Recovery Hotfix

- **Symmetric portrait seekbar card:** Rebuilt the vertical seekbar contents around one shared inner inset so both timestamps and the rail sit comfortably inside the same rounded card with balanced corner spacing. The existing glass/player-controls appearance is preserved.
- **Music-player recovery after video playback:** Audio commands are routed to MPV whenever the current item is audio, even if a stale Native engine flag remains from the preceding video. Audio timing is refreshed from MPV while the track is active, and audio scrubbing no longer gets rejected by a transient seekability state.
- **Video behavior preserved:** Native/Media3 routing remains unchanged for video items; this hotfix does not redesign the video engine or add a video surface to the music player.
- **Release scope:** This is a Standard APK hotfix for v1.1.2; the repository remains private and upstream MPV/mpvRx attribution is preserved.

## 1.1.2 — MPV Audio Recovery and Portrait Seekbar Hotfix

- **Rapid music skips:** MPV now releases any previous transition mute before arming the next load guard, preventing the audio output from remaining muted while the timeline continues after several fast song skips.
- **Video transition protection:** Each new MPV load still uses its own short transition guard, so the fix does not remove the protection against stale audio during video decoder replacement or engine handoff.
- **Portrait seekbar spacing:** Increased and equalized the outer portrait seekbar card’s vertical padding, while retaining the separated timestamp row and rail so elapsed and remaining duration stay visible.
- **Release scope:** This is a Standard APK hotfix for v1.1.1; the repository remains private and upstream MPV/mpvRx attribution is preserved.

## 1.1.1 — Native Subtitle Rendering Hotfix

- **Native caption style mapping:** Corrected the Media3 `CaptionStyleCompat` argument order so Native subtitles render with visible text, a transparent background/window, and the selected outline instead of black text and a small black cue rectangle.
- **Subtitle zoom preserved:** The existing Native pinch-scale and track-reapply behavior remains unchanged.
- **Release scope:** This is a Standard APK hotfix for v1.1.0; MPV subtitle rendering and the MPV-only music path are unchanged.

## 1.1.0 — Native Subtitle, Background Playback, and Portrait Control Fixes

- **Native subtitle rendering:** Native subtitles now use one configured Media3 subtitle renderer, preventing duplicate layers and visual artifacts when the size or track changes.
- **Transparent Native captions:** Native subtitle backgrounds and windows remain transparent instead of showing an unwanted black box. Supported style, border, color, and saved pinch-scale settings are reapplied after track updates.
- **Native background playback:** The Native player stays alive through the foreground service handoff when background playback is enabled, without incorrectly reading or controlling MPV state.
- **Music-player metadata and state:** Music playback remains MPV-based, while the music player derives its title from the current audio path or metadata instead of a stale video title.
- **Portrait controls:** The vertical player now has one transport row, compact icon-only actions, a speed/lock/audio header pill, and timestamps above the seek rail so elapsed and remaining duration stay visible.
- **Release scope:** This release contains the Standard APK variants only; the repository remains private and upstream MPV/mpvRx attribution is preserved.

## 1.0.11 — Native Playback and Portrait Controls Fixes

- **Native background playback:** When background playback is enabled, the Media3/Native player remains active as the Activity stops instead of being treated like the MPV-only service handoff.
- **Native subtitle styling:** Native captions now start with a transparent window and receive supported text, background, and edge settings from the subtitle panel while preserving the saved pinch scale across renderer and track updates.
- **Music-player synchronization:** The audio controls can use live Native state for play/pause, position, and duration instead of stale MPV properties.
- **Portrait controls:** The vertical player now uses a compact rounded control card with visible elapsed/remaining time, a centered transport row, labeled Subtitles/Zoom/Rotate/More actions, and a reference-style speed/lock/audio header pill.

## 1.0.10 — Native Subtitle and Music Player Fixes

- **Native subtitle persistence:** Native subtitle pinch zoom now keeps its scale in the active engine state and reapplies it when Media3 recreates the subtitle renderer or changes tracks.
- **Correct Native gesture baseline:** Each Native pinch starts from the last Native scale instead of MPV’s unrelated `sub-scale` value, which previously made Native appear to reset to 1.0.
- **Music-player launch routing:** Direct audio launches are identified before the first MPV track-list event, preventing the first song from briefly opening in the video-player surface.
- **Audio metadata recovery:** Embedded title, artist, album, artwork, codec, sample rate, bitrate, and channel information are used when transient MPV properties are unavailable, restoring the lossless details view for local files.

## 1.0.9 — MPV Subtitle Scale Application Fix

- **MPV rendering fix:** Removed the ASS subtitle layout path that reset `sub-scale` to `1.0` whenever subtitle positioning was reapplied.
- **Actual pinch effect:** MPV now retains the scale written by the pinch gesture or subtitle settings slider instead of showing a changed indicator while rendering the original size.
- **Native path preserved:** The v1.0.8 Media3 `SubtitleView` scaling bridge remains unchanged.
- **Private test release:** This build is for device validation; prior releases remain available and the planned public fresh-start reset is deferred.

## 1.0.8 — Shared Subtitle Pinch-Zoom Fix

- **Both engines supported:** Subtitle pinch gestures now detect selected Native subtitle tracks as well as MPV tracks.
- **Actual Native scaling:** Native pinch updates Media3’s attached `SubtitleView`; MPV continues to receive the existing `sub-scale` property update.
- **Private test release:** This build supersedes the v1.0.7 gesture-routing test and does not change the planned public fresh-start reset.

## 1.0.7 — Subtitle Pinch-Zoom Gesture Fix

- **Subtitle pinch zoom:** Pinching directly over visible subtitle text now routes to `sub-scale` instead of being misclassified as video zoom.
- **Gesture behavior preserved:** Video pinch zoom, pan, subtitle position gestures, and both Native and MPV playback paths remain unchanged outside the corrected subtitle hit test.
- **Private test release:** This build is for device validation; previous releases remain available and the planned public fresh-start reset is deferred.

## 1.0.6 — Native Multichannel Regression Fix

- **Wuthering With You regression fixed:** Native AutoSafe now preserves the six-channel layout used by the previously working DTS/DTS-HD path instead of forcing it through a stereo mixer.
- **Targeted 7.1 protection:** AutoSafe still downmixes seven- and eight-channel input, which is the narrower compatibility path needed for Tangled’s failing AudioTrack configuration.
- **Fallback preserved:** If Native genuinely fails on a device, the existing safe MPV fallback remains active and the repository stays on the private test-release track.

## 1.0.4 — Tangled Fallback and Stability Fix

- **Media3-error fallback protection:** Auto mode now records a Native/Media3 playback error as an automatic fallback for the affected item before switching to MPV, preventing the MPV Dolby Vision observer from immediately selecting Native again.
- **Tangled stability:** This covers the failure path where Media3 initializes but cannot create the required audio renderer for an 8-channel Dolby/TrueHD or E-AC-3 track, while MPV can continue playback.
- **Detached-callback crash protection:** Delayed player cleanup callbacks no longer call the detached `PlayerActivity` host after an engine transition or Activity teardown. Local cleanup state is still cleared safely.
- **Manual switching preserved:** The new protection applies to automatic fallback only; explicit decoder-sheet selection of Native or MPV remains available.

## 1.0.3 — Tangled Dolby Vision Handoff Fix

- **Observer-path fallback protection:** Auto mode now suppresses the MPV Dolby Vision track observer from immediately selecting Native again after the Native watchdog has already fallen back to MPV for the same item.
- **Tangled compatibility:** This specifically fixes Dolby Vision Profile 8.1 / HDR10-compatible files such as Tangled, where Native can initialize and decode but fail to produce usable visible output on some devices.
- **Manual switching preserved:** The guard applies only to automatic Auto-mode reselection. Choosing Native or MPV manually from the decoder sheet still works.

## 1.0.2 — Mpv∞ Update Feed Fix

- **Own release feed:** The in-app updater now checks `ZHINFINITY/Mpv-infinity` releases instead of the inherited mpvRx release feed, so it will no longer offer mpvRx versions such as 2.1.0.
- **Version alignment:** The corrective build is version `1.0.2` and downloads only the compatible Mpv∞ Standard APK from the Mpv∞ release assets.

## 1.0.0 — Feature & Experience Release

### 🧲 Native Torrent Streaming & Media Browsing
- **Built-in Torrent Streaming Engine**: Stream and play `.torrent` files, magnet links, and HTTP torrent URLs directly with background piece caching, sequential download prioritization, and integrated local streaming server.
- **Dedicated Torrent File & Episode Picker**: Interactive file selection screen showing all playable video and audio items within multi-file torrents, complete with individual file sizes, format tags, launch status, and episode labels.
- **Anime & Series Torrent Cards**: Redesigned Torrent history cards in Network Streaming that automatically group multi-episode series with expandable episode lists, poster art, synopsis, release year, and media type tags.
- **Smart TMDB Metadata & Artwork Parsing**: Multi-stage metadata engine that intelligently parses filenames, seasons, and episodes (supporting complex scene tags, colon separators like `S1:E1`, cross-format `1x01`, dashes, and anime numbering) with multi-candidate fallback search against TMDB to fetch high-resolution posters, backdrops, and overviews.

### Google Cast
- **Native Cast control**: Added the standard stateful Google Cast button to portrait and landscape player controls, including a one-time layout migration for existing users.
- **Local and remote media handoff**: Receiver-accessible HTTP(S) streams are loaded directly; Android-local `file://` and `content://` media use a tokenized temporary LAN server with byte-range seeking and CORS support.
- **Playback continuity**: The sender transfers title, play state, duration, and current position, pauses local playback after a successful receiver load, and restores local playback at the receiver position when casting ends.
- **Complete sender controls**: Added Cast SDK expanded controls, notification/lock-screen integration, reconnection support, and receiver volume controls.
- **Receiver compatibility guardrail**: Casting uses Google's Default Media Receiver, so containers and codecs unsupported by the selected TV/Chromecast are not transcoded automatically.

### Playback Lifecycle & Background Playback
- **One background playback switch**: Audio preferences and the player background button now control the same persistent setting for both audio and video.
- **Reliable screen lock and unlock handling**: Playback now follows the selected background policy across screen-off, lock-screen, unlock, and resume transitions without losing the prior play state.
- **PiP lifecycle coordination**: Picture-in-picture transitions, PiP dismissal, screen locking while in PiP, and activity teardown now share one lifecycle policy instead of competing playback paths.
- **Persistent task-removal playback**: Swiping the app out of Recents no longer kills an active foreground playback session, so background audio continues until explicitly stopped.
- **Foreground service cleanup**: Disabling background playback immediately pauses playback and stops its foreground service and notification.
- **Preference migration**: Existing users who enabled the legacy audio-only screen-lock option are migrated to the unified background playback setting.

### Subtitle Search
- **Results appear as they arrive**: Online subtitle results are merged into the list as each selected SubHub source or Wyzie completes instead of waiting for every request.

### Playback Engine
- **Updated bundled mpvlib**: Refreshed the packaged `mpvlib.aar` used by all preview APK variants.

### Media Library & Audio Browsing
- **Preference-aware media switch**: The Video/Audio selector appears only when audio browsing is enabled, remembers the selected library type, and resets to Video when audio browsing is disabled.
- **Complete audio playlists**: Audio launches now populate the active playlist so previous and next controls update and navigate correctly.
- **Square audio artwork**: Audio thumbnails use a square presentation in both grid and list cards while video thumbnails remain 16:9.
- **Audio-safe editing**: Video compression actions are hidden for audio selections and guarded from opening with audio files.

### Player Polish
- **Rounded streaming cache indicator**: Buffered seekbar progress is clipped to the same pill-shaped ends as the normal seek track.
- **Smoother natural visualizer**: Higher-rate spectrum capture, tuned frequency envelopes, frame-time-aware interpolation, and responsive beat decay make the audio blob react fluidly without harsh jumps.

### AI Providers & Smart Tools
- **Current provider protocols**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter, Together, and OpenCode Zen requests now follow their current API shapes; OpenCode models are routed through Responses, Messages, Gemini, or Chat Completions as required.
- **Resilient response parsing**: Text, multipart content, reasoning blocks, citations, provider errors, and both object- and array-based model lists are parsed without relying on one rigid response schema.
- **Thinking-model rename fixes**: AI rename and subtitle-title output now discard reasoning and code fences, accept structured JSON fields, preserve extensions, and reject empty or unsafe names.
- **Provider-specific model memory**: Each provider keeps its own selected model and cached model list, preventing stale selections when switching services.
- **Correct speech endpoints**: Groq and OpenAI use supported transcription models, while OpenRouter speech requests use its current base64 JSON audio format.

## 1.5.0-preview.4 — Preview Release

### Google Cast

## 1.5.0-preview.3 — Preview Release

### Playback Hotfix
- **Audio and video transitions rebuilt**: Every item is loaded with file-local video-track selection, preventing audio state from producing a black screen on the next video.
- **Reliable next-item playback**: Runtime navigation now sends an actual mpv `loadfile` replacement and clears the previous EOF pause state.
- **Preference-safe EOF handling**: Autoplay, Repeat One, Repeat All, Shuffle, playlist mode, and close-at-end now behave consistently, including very short audio files.
- **Safe seeking**: Audio never enters the native video-thumbnail path, and video thumbnails are generated only on demand while scrubbing—not automatically during file load.
- **Separated render surfaces**: The blob surface is mounted only for media independently identified as audio, preventing it from covering video during track-list transitions.
- **True beat response**: With audio-capture permission, real FFT data exclusively drives the blob; brightness and bloom are reduced while bass onsets pulse more clearly.

### 🔊 Audio Blob Visualizer
- **OpenGL ES 3.0 blob visualizer** — when playing audio without cover art, a reactive 3D blob appears behind the player controls. The blob morphs, pulses, and shifts color based on audio energy with a bloom/glow post-process.
- **Touch rotation**: Drag the blob to rotate it in 3D.
- **Pinch zoom fixed**: The blob now properly shrinks/enlarges when pinching — `pinchScaleFromRenderer()` was hardcoded to always return `1f`, resetting zoom on every new gesture.
- **Smaller default size**: Camera distance increased so the blob fits cleanly within screen bounds instead of nearly filling the height.
- **Audio Preferences toggle**: New "Audio blob visualizer" switch in Settings > Audio to enable or disable it.
- **Audio filter setting moved**: Audio filter (compressor/equalizer) options now live in Audio Preferences instead of the player's MoreSheet.

### 🎬 yt-dlp Changes
- **Audio quality preferences**: Independent bitrate caps for `Auto`, 64, 128, 192, and 256 kbps — composed with existing codec, resolution, FPS, HDR, and container selectors.
- **Serialized URL loading**: Initial and replacement URL loads now use one cancellable serialized job, preventing overlapping libmpv commands when links are pasted rapidly.
- **Graceful error recovery**: Recoverable URL load failures return to the player UI with an error message instead of escaping to the process-wide crash handler.
- **Audio quality removed from MoreSheet**: yt-dlp audio quality selector moved from the player's MoreSheet to yt-dlp settings.

### 📻 Audio Browsing
- **MediaStore + filesystem discovery** for common audio formats, neutral media counts, audio MIME mapping, and Android 13 `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` permission handling.
- **Audio cards** show metadata titles, embedded cover artwork when available (via `audio-display=embedded-first`), and a music-note fallback icon.
- **Portrait-only playback** — audio files force sensor-portrait orientation and prevent the rotation action from switching back to landscape.
- **Sibling playlist includes audio** — when "Include audio" is on, the next/previous track list includes audio files from the same folder.
- **Audio icon placeholder fix**: Exported icon now displays correctly for audio files without cover art.
- **Audio pitch correction fix**: Pitch correction no longer persists when switching to a new video — resets to default per-file.
- **Audio autoplay race condition fixed**: Eliminated a race condition that could cause audio files to fail starting playback.

### 🌐 Network & External Playback
- **WebDAV PROPFIND fix**: Connection checks now use a depth-zero `PROPFIND` request instead of Sardine's `HEAD`-based `exists()` call, making it work with servers like FileBrowser Quantum that reject `HEAD` on DAV collections.
- **WebDAV trailing slash**: Collection URLs consistently keep a trailing slash during validation and browsing.
- **External-player discovery**: Added a MIME-only intent filter so external-player pickers can find mpvRx before attaching the final video or audio URI.
- **More protocol support**: Added `gopher://`, `sctp://`, and `data://` to network stream detection and intent filters.
- **Stream compatibility improved**: Better handling of edge-case media streams and improved browsing reliability.

### 🌲 Tree View Navigation
- **Configurable path compression**: New `Off`, 1–5, and `Unlimited` choices for single-child folder flattening. Applied independently per navigation step, preserving predictable physical paths. Tree View refreshes instantly when the depth changes.

### 🎨 Icon Consistency
- Converted all three `painterResource(R.drawable.ic_material_symbols_check)` usages to `Icons.Default.Check` through the app's `AppIcon` / `Icon` system.
- `SectionHeader.leadingIcon` and `CompactExpressiveIconButton.imageVector` now accept `AppIcon` instead of raw `ImageVector`, keeping everything on the unified icon pipeline.

### 🔊 Audio Playback Runtime Fixes
- **`local_media_path` extra**: Internal launches now pass the resolved filesystem path alongside the content URI, giving mpv a reliable fallback when `content://` URIs fail.
- **Serialized load dispatcher**: Added a dedicated `Dispatchers.Default.limitedParallelism(1)` dispatcher for media loading — prevents race conditions when queuing multiple load commands.
- **`vid=auto` before playback**: Non-M3U file loads explicitly reset the video track to auto before loading, avoiding "no video track" state from previous audio-only plays.
- **`audio-display=embedded-first`**: Enabled MPV's embedded cover art rendering for audio files.
- **Orientation on audio launch**: `setOrientation()` checks `isKnownAudioLaunch()` immediately, before the track-list event settles — fixes the black-screen + landscape glitch on audio start.
- **Subtitle "Off" option**: Added an explicit "Off" choice in the player subtitle sheet so users can disable subtitles without cycling through all tracks.

### 🗑️ Folder Deletion Behavior
- **Media-only deletion (default)**: Deleting a folder now only removes audio/video files — other files (images, logs, documents) are left untouched.
- **"Delete folder + all contents" toggle**: New option in Appearance Settings > File Browser to switch back to full recursive deletion when needed.
- **Album View cleanup fix**: Fixed an issue where the last video file in a folder was deleted but the empty folder remained.

### 📱 Tablet & Display
- **Dynamic refresh rate**: The player can now dynamically adjust the display refresh rate to match the video frame rate for smoother playback.
- **Dual-pane navigation fix**: Resolved a state leak that could cause crashes when navigating in tablet dual-pane mode.
- **Dual-pane settings button hidden**: The redundant settings button is no longer shown in dual-pane mode on tablets.
- **Folder card height fix**: Manual grid column counts now align properly with folder card heights in dual-pane layout.

### 🔍 Settings Search
- **Search history**: Recently searched terms are saved and displayed for quick re-selection.
- **Search suggestions**: The search field now shows contextual suggestions as you type.
- **Reflection-based fallback**: Settings search can dynamically discover settings via reflection when static indices are incomplete.



## 1.5.0-preview.2 — Preview Release

### 📦 MpvLib Update
- Updated mpv library and its dependencies

### ⚡ Performance & Startup
- **Faster video open**: Opening a video file now uses `Dispatchers.Default` for the `playFile()` call — keeps the UI thread free and the player starts faster
- **Leaner startup sync**: The MPV directory sync no longer blanket-copies `shaders/` and `fonts/` on every launch — only config files, scripts, and `script-opts/` are synced upfront. Shaders referenced in `mpv.conf` are pulled on demand via `syncReferencedShaders()`, and fonts are handled by the font manager. This cuts down startup time noticeably, especially for users with large shader packs
- **Removed Dynamic Speed Overlay**: The old `SpeedControlSlider` (a full-size overlay with a dot-track slider) and `CompactSpeedIndicator` are gone. Hold-speed is now shown as a simple, clean text pill (e.g. "2x"). The `showDynamicSpeedOverlay` preference has been removed too — no more toggles, no more clutter
- **Snap-to-preset hold speed**: The hold-speed gesture now snaps to fixed presets (0.5x → 1x → 1.5x → 2x → 2.5x → 3x → 3.5x → 4x) instead of a free-form slider. The settings slider also snaps to these values, so what you see is what you get
- **Hold speed range capped**: Boost speed is now capped at 0.5x–4x range (previously went up to 6x)

### 📱 Tablet Dual-Pane Layouts
- **Folder view dual pane**: On tablets (600dp+ smallest screen width), you can now see your folder list on the left and a video list on the right — tap a folder, see its contents immediately beside it. A new "Dual Pane View" toggle in Appearance Settings lets you turn this on/off
- **Settings dual pane**: The Settings screen also gets a two-panel layout on tablets — the section list stays on the left, and the selected settings page opens on the right. The currently active section is highlighted with a subtle background
- **Back navigation in dual pane**: Pressing back in dual-pane mode deselects the folder/settings page instead of closing the screen

### 🎥 Player & Subtitles
- **Invert swipe subtitle direction**: New "Invert swipe subtitles direction" setting in Gesture Preferences. When enabled, swiping left-to-right seeks backward and right-to-left seeks forward — useful if you prefer the mirrored behaviour
- **Screenshot overhaul**: Screenshot filename templates got a proper rework:
  - `%wH`, `%wM`, `%wS`, `%wT` now use the **video playback position** (not the wall clock time) — so screenshot filenames actually match the video timestamp
  - New template placeholders: `%F` (filename without extension), `%P` (position as `HH:MM:SS.mmm`), `%p` (position as `HH:MM:SS`)
  - `%f` now resolves from the actual filename first, falling back to media-title — more reliable naming
- **Korean Jamo subtitle fix**: Downloaded subtitles that use Korean Jamo (composite characters) now go through NFC Unicode normalization. No more broken/corrupted Korean glyphs in subtitles
- **Subtitle search keyboard fix**: Added `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` to PlayerActivity — the subtitle search dialog no longer gets hidden behind the on-screen keyboard
- **Subtitle persistence fix**: External subtitles and subtitle settings now survive across playback sessions more reliably. Added `addSubtitleSuspend()` (suspend version) for better coroutine handling during subtitle loading
- **Cache indicator fix**: The buffered range on the seekbar no longer double-counts the played portion — it now shows the correct remaining buffer ahead of the playhead
- **Color hex fix**: `toColorHexString()` now manually extracts ARGB components instead of using `Int.toHexString()` which produced wrong values for some colors

### 🛠️ Lua Script Improvements
- **Lua `require()` support**: Custom Lua scripts using `require()` can now find modules in `script-modules/` subdirectories. The app recursively syncs helper folders from `scripts/` to internal storage, so Lua's C-level `fopen()` can actually read them. Modules are also cleaned up when scripts are disabled in settings

### 🧹 Cleanup
- **Removed libpython binaries**: Deleted ~50 MB of unused `libpython_bin.so` files from all 4 architectures — they were never loaded by the app
- **Simplified MPV version display**: Removed the `cleanBundledMpvVersion()` hack in CrashActivity — MPV version now shows cleanly without needing string patching
- **Fonts folder no longer auto-set**: When changing the base storage root, the fonts folder preference is no longer blindly overwritten — it's only cleared if it was pointing at the old root. This prevents accidental font-folder resets

## 1.3.9

> # 🚀 **CURL IS NOW SUPPORTED!** 
> ### ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL** — This is brand new and may or may not work properly on your device. ⚠️
> Lua and JavaScript scripts can now make HTTP requests through the new native libcurl bridge via JNI.
> Use it, break it, and report issues so we can make it stable!, see `MPVRX_CUSTOM_COMMANDS.d` for tutorial on how to use in Lua and JS.
>
> **What this means:** You can now write scripts that fetch data from the internet — APIs, subtitles, metadata, you name it — all through libcurl compiled directly into the app.

- AI support has been updated. Gemini is removed and OpenCode Zen AI is now available for AI rename, subtitle formatting, and subtitle translation.
- AI model lists now come from the provider APIs instead of a saved model list in the app. OpenRouter also marks free models using the pricing data returned by OpenRouter itself.
- Background playback is fixed so repeat keeps working after using the headphone button, and returning to the player no longer restarts the current stream from the beginning.
- Subtitle search has been updated for the latest Wyzie source changes.
- Added Hybrid Skip Markers. The player can now check IntroDB, TIDB, and AniSkip together and use whichever result is found first.
- Anime4K settings are now easier to use with a collapsible section in Decoder Preferences and also Added Optimization by Sunny Vishnu .
- Added a setting to show or hide Media Info from Android's share/open-with screen.
- Added documentation for custom Lua/JS player commands in `MPV_INFINITY_CUSTOM_COMMANDS.md`.

## 1.3.8

- **Integrated yt-dlp by [**SunnyVishnu3**](https://github.com/SunnyVishnu3)** — Added full yt-dlp integration for video watching audio/video from YouTube and other supported sites directly within the app (_Dont expect from me to add Download Functionality_). **Note: You need to download yt-dlp first (Settings > Advanced > yt-dlp Manager) before playing YouTube links — don't be clueless.**
- Fixed Issue of USer defined Colors Filters were not getting Saved and not getting applied through Mpv conf by [**SunnyVishnu3**](https://github.com/SunnyVishnu3)
- Fixed Gemini AI Error Generating / Translating Subs.
- Fixed Crashing issue of MpvRx , in a nutshell Ambient mode and Custom lua were not initialized in Sync causing to crash player sometimes
- That's all for Today Adiosss!!

## 1.3.7

- **Updated Wyzie subtitle API integration** — Synced with latest Wyzie API changes: added `ai` field for AI-translated subtitle detection, updated provider sources list (removed `subdl`, `podnapisi`, `ajatttools`; added `tvsubtitles`), and fixed TMDB endpoints to include API key authentication.
- **Material 3 Expressive Design** — Complete visual overhaul using Material 3 Expressive design system for a more modern, fluid, and engaging experience
- **Smoother Animations** — Replaced rigid linear transitions with spring-based physics animations throughout the app (navigation, controls, browser, dialogs)
- Added Voltage Battery Temperature And improved the style of Page 6 
- Added Optimized Ambient Mode with Eco Battery Saver Mode who want to take feel of Ambient without much Battery Impact
- Removed Dead Code and also Optimized some File Handling / Ui Rendering Operations
- **Settings export now stores app version**  exported XML files include the app version, so import dialogs show the correct version instead of "unknown".
- **HEVC 10bit thumbnails**  added a software-decoder fallback using Android's MediaCodec API. When the system can't decode a video frame (e.g. HEVC 10bit on devices without hardware support), the app now tries Google's software decoder before giving up. This means more thumbnails will show up on devices with limited codec support ( To be tested Propelry on unsupported device).
- **Fixed app icon on Android 16**  changed the adaptive icon background from transparent to opaque black so the icon doesn't disappear on launchers that don't handle transparency well.
- **User mpv.conf now has highest priority**  during player startup, your mpv.conf settings are re-applied after all app defaults so they always take precedence. but some of the Hardcoded things doesnt change like for example `sid, aid`.
- 

## 1.3.6

- **Six AI providers, one gorgeous settings page**  OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Together joined Groq and Gemini in a completely redesigned UI. Every provider gets its own API key, every single model is visible (free ones get a bold green badge), and the new searchable model picker sorts free models to the top. The offline model experience got a premium card-based overhaul too  tiers, speed/translation badges, device recommendations, DeepSeek-R1 support, reasoning toggles, and a benchmark button for downloaded models. One-tap download, delete, and switch between models without ever leaving the screen.

- **Subtitle translation**  SUPPORTS ASS Subs Translation tooooooooo..... , you can now configure your target languages once in settings. One language means one tap to translate. Two or more means a clean picker showing only the languages you chose. Translation progress appears right on the video screen (even with the sheet closed), partially translated subs survive restarts, and a red X lets you cancel mid-translation instantly. When using local models, the system automatically picks the best downloaded model for each language, keeps it warm between chunks, and never runs two local AI jobs at once.

- **Generate subtitles from video audio**  **_(EXPERIMENTAL)_** This is work in progress might not work Don't baby Cry that this shit aint working ,i ain't getting paid enough to implement this whole heartedly , so what it does is -> one tap generates subtitles using the audio you're already playing. Media3 extraction feeds Groq, Gemini, or offline Whisper, and the resulting SRT/VTT saves automatically.

- **Smarter AI across the board**  reasoning tags are automatically stripped from final results, token limits prevent stalls in heavy tasks, and every AI feature (rename, formatting, translation) comes with customizable prompts that fall back gracefully to built-in instructions.

- **Real-time subtitle toggle**  new on/off switch in AI settings to control real-time subtitle generation from audio. When off, the indicator and generate button are hidden from the player.

- **AI features respect the master switch**  turning off AI Integration now hides all AI indicators (translation, real-time subs) and buttons (generate, translate, format) from the player view. Renamed "AI Subtitle Search Formatting" to "AI Search" for clarity.


## 1.3.5

- **Removed Play Store and F-Droid build variants**  streamlined to a single `standard` flavor with full update support and all features enabled.
- **Revamped README**  comprehensive feature documentation organized by category, UPI QR code and Buy Me a Coffee links in the Support section.
- **SMB Network Thumbnail Generation**  fixed thumbnail generation for SMB shares through Codex AI (Beta).
- **Bulk AI Rename**  rename multiple files at once using Gemini or Groq with concurrency limiting and edge case handling.
- **AI Subtitle Translation**  translate subtitles using AI providers with custom prompts, progress indication, and user preference management.
- **AI Subtitle Translation Enhancements**  in-house developed translation pipeline with fully customizable prompts and per-user preference overrides.

## 1.3.4

- Added Window Offset to prevent Camera notch overlap issues


## 1.3.3

- Fixed Background Playback and Pip issues 
- Anime4K should feel much smoother now. The player now uses the clean six-preset Anime4K flow from the reference app and avoids piling old shader work on top of the new preset when you switch modes.
- Anime4K is still off by default, but when you turn it on the picker is simpler: Off, A, B, C, A+, B+, and C+.
- Moved the Fast / Balanced / High Anime4K choice into Decoder settings, with Balanced as the default.
- Removed frame interpolation because it added a lot of GPU load and did not add enough real value.
- Removed the old OneThird and Halfway thumbnail choices.
- Removed the unused old player screen path.
- Cleaned up the track sheets so audio, subtitle, chapter, decoder, and online subtitle lists no longer depend on the old generic sheet.
- Removed SubDL from subtitle search sources.
- Network streaming is now opt-in instead of being enabled on a fresh install.
- HDR and Ambient controls are no longer placed on the default player buttons, so heavy visual extras stay out of the way unless you add them yourself.
- Turning HDR on now starts with Linear HDR by default.
- The app now does less background media scanning and cache cleanup on startup, which should help large libraries open with less churn.
- Added new MpvLib File with Some Optimization and Removing Deprecated Andorid Versions
- Thumbnails are now Loaded Faster and more Precisly

## 1.3.2

### HDR hdr-toys Pipeline

- Replaced the old 3-mode HDR system (Off / SDR with HDR / Normal HDR) with a proper shader-based pipeline powered by [hdr-toys](https://github.com/natural-harmonia-gropius/hdr-toys).
- Four HDR modes are now available: **BT.2100 PQ** (HDR10), **BT.2100 HLG**, **BT.2020**, and **Linear HDR** (mpv-native, no shaders).
- 77 GLSL shaders are bundled in the app and copied to the mpv config directory on first use  no manual setup required.
- The HDR panel no longer shows an "Off" option. Off is the default and is toggled by the HDR button; the panel only presents the four active modes.
- Selecting a mode while GPU Next + Vulkan is unavailable shows a clear error pill and falls back to Off safely.
- Added `boostSdrToHdr` preference (used by the Linear HDR path).
- `HdrToysManager` cleanly removes all hdr-toys shaders when switching to Off or when the pipeline is not ready, so no stale shaders leak between sessions.

### Thermal & Battery Improvements

- Added `ThermalMonitor`  samples `PowerManager.getThermalHeadroom()` (Android 11+) every 10 seconds during playback.
- Ambient shader sample budget is automatically capped based on thermal headroom: 8 samples (severe), 12 (moderate), 18 (mild), uncapped (cool).
- Anime4K is proactively downgraded to C/Fast when thermal headroom drops below 40%, before frame drops even start.
- Ambient shader recompilation is now skipped when all parameters are identical to the last compiled version  reduces unnecessary GPU stutter on orientation changes and no-op callbacks.
- Removed redundant dual position polling: the event-driven `time-pos` observer and the polling loop were both updating the same StateFlow, causing double seek-bar recompositions on every MPV event.
- Background playback position poll interval halved from 250 ms to 500 ms when controls are not visible, cutting idle JNI wake-ups by 50%.

### Stats Page 6  Fixes

- **GPU estimate bar fixed**: was using cumulative drop + delay totals that drifted to 100% after long sessions and added a fixed FPS-proportional baseline (120fps with zero drops showed 70% GPU load). Now uses per-second delta counts relative to the current frame rate  0 drops = 0%, all frames dropped = 100%.
- **CPU label corrected**: relabelled from "CPU Usage" to "App CPU (this process)" to accurately reflect that `getElapsedCpuTime()` measures only MpvRx's own process, not the whole device.
- **Frame drop text now shows per-second deltas** alongside the all-time totals, so you can tell current rendering pressure at a glance.
- **Pause-aware poll backoff**: the stats loop backs off from 1 s to 2 s intervals when playback is paused, cutting pointless JNI calls when metrics are static.

### Gesture & Action Overlay Toggles

- Added a new **"Gesture & Action Overlays"** section in Player Settings with seven independent on/off switches:
  - **Volume slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during volume swipe
  - **Brightness slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during brightness swipe
  - **Hold speed overlay**  speed badge and slider shown during long-press speed boost
  - **Aspect ratio feedback**  pill shown when cycling aspect ratio
  - **Zoom level feedback**  pill shown when pinching to zoom
  - **Repeat & shuffle feedback**  pill shown when toggling repeat or shuffle
  - **Action feedback pills**  brief text pills from custom buttons, ambient toggle, subtitle drag, and Lua/JS scripts
- All overlays default to **on**, so existing behaviour is unchanged until the user opts out.
- Disabling an overlay suppresses only the visual pill  the underlying gesture action (volume change, speed change, etc.) still happens normally.

## 1.3.1

- Updated mpv library dependency from `mpv-android-lib-v0.0.1.aar` to `mpvlib.aar` and removed the old AAR.
- Added Multiple new provider to Wyzie subtitle sources.
- PiP and background playback now save the latest watched position instead of returning to the timestamp from before PiP started.
