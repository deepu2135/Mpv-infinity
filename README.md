## 🔋 Battery Optimization Guide for Mpv∞

For efficient playback, begin with Mpv∞'s default configuration and enable additional rendering features only when you need them. The following choices usually reduce unnecessary GPU and battery work:

- **Use `gpu` for ordinary playback** when you do not need the Vulkan-based `gpu-next` renderer.
- **Use the built-in `fast` profile** for a lightweight starting point.
- **Enable Anime4K and other shaders selectively**, because they run on every rendered frame and can increase GPU load.
- **Check the statistics pages** during long playback to observe battery, thermal, frame, and rendering behavior on your device.
- **Keep custom mpv.conf settings focused**, since aggressive scaling, debanding, and shader chains can increase startup time, memory use, and power consumption.

Actual power use depends on the device, codec, resolution, refresh rate, renderer, and selected shaders. Mpv∞'s thermal-aware safeguards can reduce shader quality when the device is under sustained load.

## Release Notes For Maintainers

To cut a signed GitHub release through Actions, configure these repository secrets:

| Secret Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `SIGNING_KEYSTORE` | Base64-encoded keystore file (`.jks` or `.keystore`) |
| `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias inside the keystore |
| `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD` | Password for the keystore |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the signing key |

Then bump `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, create a tag, and push it:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

Preview releases use the same flow with preview tags such as:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.1-preview.1 -m "Preview release"
git push origin v1.0.1-preview.1
```
